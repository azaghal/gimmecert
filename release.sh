$program, interactive utility release script

Usage: $program [OPTIONS] {prepare,publish} version

$program is a utility release script. The intention is to make the
release process easier in a project.

Two positional arguments are required - operation, and version.

No matter what operation is selected, a number of validation steps are
performed to ensure the release is prepared/published from a correct
working environment. For example, if there are uncommitted changes,
release process wil fail.

When specifying the version, the following limitations should be kept
in mind:

- Version must be specified in format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, where MAJOR,
  MINOR, and PATCH are non-negative integers. It is not allowed to
  have both MAJOR and MINOR set to zero (0).
- Version 0.0.0 is treated as development version, and cannot be used
  for releases.
- Releases from master branch are supported only for new major/minor
  releases (where patch number is 0). E.g. 0.1.0, 1.0.0.
- Releases from maintenance branches are supported only for new patch
  releases that the intended maintenance branch covers.

The following operations are supported:

prepare

    Prepares the release by making the necessary changes in the local
    git repository.The process involves:

    - Ensuring that all tests are passing.
    - Updating version information in release notes and package setup
      script. This change is then committed using a signed commit.
    - Starting a new section in the release notes (in the master
      and/or maintenance branch), and updating the version in package
      setup script to mark it as development. This change is then
      committed using a signed commit.
    - Creating the maintenance branch if necessary. This action is
      only performed when releasing from the master branch. Naming
      convention for maintenance branch is "maintenance/MAJOR.MINOR".

publish

    Publishes the specified release. The process involves:

    - Building the source and binary distribution using the specified
      tag.
    - Pushing changes from local master and/or maintenance branch to
      the upstream (origin) repository.
    - Pushing tag corresponding to the specified version number to the
      upstream (origin) repository.
    - Uploading the source and binary distribution to PyPI.

$program accepts the following options:

    -r pypi_repository_url
        Use the designated PyPI repository URL. Default is
        https://pypi.org/legacy/.
    -d
        Enable debug mode. Produces more output helpful for debugging
        the script itself.
    -v
        Show script licensing information.
    -h
        Show usage help.
